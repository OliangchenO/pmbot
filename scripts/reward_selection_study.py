"""Reward-prioritized selection & position-scaling study.

Research questions (see REPORT_reward_selection.md for the write-up):

  Q1. We currently rank eligible markets by reward DENSITY (pool / book
      liquidity). Should we instead rank by EXPECTED CAPTURED REWARD
      (pool x our score-share), which is what actually lands in the wallet?

  Q2. As capital grows, should we add more MARKETS (raise top_n_markets) or
      bigger POSITIONS per market (raise max_capital_per_market, e.g. 50->100)?

  Q3. What does this do to SAFETY (tail losses), measured against our own
      realized markout distribution?

Everything is pure-stdlib and reproducible. Inputs are either MEASURED from
data/live_metrics.db or STATED assumptions you can edit at the top. Run:
